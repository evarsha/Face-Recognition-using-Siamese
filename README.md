# Face-Recognition-using-Siamese

FaceNet learns a neural network that encodes a face image into a vector of 128 numbers. By comparing two such vectors, we can then determine if two pictures are of the same person.

Implemented the triplet loss function
Used a pretrained model to map face images into 128-dimensional encodings
Used these encodings to perform face verification and face recognition
Note the accuracy and stop
